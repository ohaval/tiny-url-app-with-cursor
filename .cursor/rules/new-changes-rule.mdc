# Code formats

- Always prefer to use absolute imports instead of relative ones.
- Try to not exceed line length of 80, but in special cases if needed you can use a # noqa: E501 on the end of the line if needed.

# Git Add and Commit

This rule file is relevant for most of the requests I will ask you to perform some task, like add a feature, fix tests, improve readability, etc..
The instruction is to always run `make lint` and `make lt` to make sure no linting or test errors, and then `git add` the chagnes you did, and `git commit` them at the end.
